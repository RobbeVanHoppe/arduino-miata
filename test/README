
This directory now contains a native-hosted unit test setup that can be
expanded with additional test suites.

- Tests run against the `native` PlatformIO environment using lightweight
  Arduino stubs in `test/support`, so they do not require hardware.
- The `platformio.ini` entry for `env:native` includes only the
  sensor-related sources to keep builds fast and deterministic.

To run the tests locally:

```
pio test -e native
```
